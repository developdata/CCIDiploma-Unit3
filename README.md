# Unit 3 Physical Computing
This repository contains information and code for the physical computing unit for the Diploma in Creative Computing of the Creative Computing Institute.

The Unit will be using Arduino's to explore physical computing. It will also explore how physical and digital computing can be integrated to create interactive systems. By using the idea of play you will be creating interactive physical systems using a range of inputs and outputs. 

## Physical Computing
 Physical computing allows you to create programmed systems that are manifested with physical objects. This could be objects that sense and interact with the world, that respond to data, that send data that change other systems, or a mixture of the three.

## Assessment
For your assessment you need to produce a physical computing project based around the idea of play. You need to create a video to present the project as well as a pdf document detailing your project. This is an individual project, that should demonstrate your learning during the unit as well as your interpretation of the brief (add link to brief).

## Week 1 - Thursday 22nd October 2020: Introduction to Physical computing
This workshop will include an introduction to physical computing, Arduino and play. There will be a demonstration on setting up the Arduino programming environment and getting started with some basic components. You will start to connect components to an Arduino and write a short program.

### Week 1 materials
Add link to slides
Add link to Arduino book pdf

### Homework
Over the next three weeks, in groups of three you will be going through the Arduino project book as homework. 

## Week 2 - Thursday 29th October 2020: Introduction to JavaScript and Node.js
If you want to mix physical components with digital interfaces using a browser page is a good way to do it, which means getting to know some web languages including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This workshop will be an introduction to JavaScript and Node.js. JavaScript

If you want to mix physical components with digital interfaces using a browser page is a good way to do it, which means getting to know some web languages including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This workshop will be an introduction to JavaScript and Node.js. JavaScript is a programming language that lets you make web pages more interactive. Node.js is a JavaScript based server side platform, this means that it runs the code on the server, not on the web browser. Using Node.js you will be able to pass data to and from an Arduino to web pages. I’ll go through this in later weeks, this week I will go through the fundamentals of the code needed to create a Node.js server and some basic interactions.

### Week 2 materials
Getting started [with JavaScript]( https://glitch.com/edit/#!/start-javascript)
Setting up [Node.js]( https://glitch.com/edit/#!/start-nodeapp)
[Websockets]( https://glitch.com/edit/#!/start-sockets)

### Homework
In your groups of three keep working through the Arduino project book, as you go, try remixing a bit.
